4 the condition manifests itself as attacks lasting from a few minutes to several hours	paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia
0 they may include but are not limited to
1 because mast cells play a role in allergic reactions the symptoms of mastocytosis often are similar to the symptoms of an allergic reaction
2 when too many mast cells exist in a person s body and undergo degranulation the additional chemicals can cause a number of symptoms which can vary over time and can range in intensity from mild to severe	mastocytosis
0 the remainder mainly experience the symptoms of anemia such as tiredness shortness of breath and palpitations
1 this phenomenon mainly occurs in those who have the primary form of pnh who will notice this at some point in their disease course
2 as the urine is more concentrated in the morning this is when the color is most pronounced
3 the classic sign of pnh is red discoloration of the urine due to the presence of hemoglobin and hemosiderin from the breakdown of red blood cells	paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria pnh

0 babies are often cyanotic at birth to varying degrees depending on the severity of their defects
1 since the ductus arteriosus usually closes within eleven days after birth blood flow may be severely restricted and eventually blocked leading to dangerously low circulation and eventually shock
2 this blood must flow through a patent open ductus arteriosus
3 as blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium it must pass through an atrial septal defect to the right side of the heart so it can be pumped to the rest of the body
4 in people with hlhs the aorta and left ventricle are underdeveloped beginning in utero and the aortic and mitral valves are either too small to allow sufficient blood flow or are atretic closed altogether

0 physical examination of someone with hypocalcemia may show tetany but it is also possible to provoke tetany of the facial muscles by tapping on the facial nerve a phenomenon known as chvostek s sign or by using the cuff of a sphygmomanometer to temporarily obstruct the blood flow to the arm a phenomenon known as trousseau s sign of latent tetany
1 crampy abdominal pain may occur
2 many also report a number of subjective symptoms such as fatigue headaches bone pain and insomnia
3 as a result people with hypoparathyroidism can experience paresthesia an unpleasant tingling sensation around the mouth and in the hands and feet as well as muscle cramps and severe spasms known as tetany that affect the hands and feet

2 myoclonic seizure can be described as jumps or jolts experienced in a single extremity or even the entire body	myoclonus
0 epileptic myoclonus is an elementary electroclinical manifestation of epilepsy involving descending neurons whose spatial spread or temporal self sustained repetition amplification can trigger overt epileptic activity
1 myclonus jerks can be epileptic or not epileptic
2 they usually occur without detectable loss of consciousness and may be generalized regional or focal on the eeg tracing
3 spike activity produced from the brain is usually correlated with brief jerks seen on emg or excessive muscle artifact
4 eeg is used to read brain wave activity
5 the jerks are usually involuntary and can lead to falls
6 myoclonus can be described as brief jerks of the body it can involve any part of the body but it is mostly seen in limbs or facial muscles	myoclonic epilepsy
0 the symptoms of myoclonus dystonia vary substantially in severity

2 acute tender erythematous plaques nodes pseudovesicles and occasionally blisters with an annular or arciform pattern occur on the head neck legs and arms particularly the back of the hands and fingers	febrile neutrophilic dermatosis
0 this form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body s ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions
1 it is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids
2 it may be accompanied by severe itching swelling and pain
3 psoriatic erythroderma erythrodermic psoriasis involves widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface
4 these areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows knees scalp and back

0 symptoms can be aggravated when leaning to the right or taking a supine face up position
1 a hayes maneuver pressure applied below the umbilicus in cephalad and dorsal direction elevates the root of the sma also slightly easing the constriction
2 for many symptoms are partially relieved when in the left lateral decubitus or knee to chest position or in the prone face down position
3 food fear is a common development among patients with the chronic form of sma syndrome
4 this in turn increases the duodenal compression spurring a vicious cycle
5 in some cases of sma syndrome severe malnutrition accompanying spontaneous wasting may occur
6 in infants feeding difficulties and poor weight gain are also frequent symptoms
7 signs and symptoms include early satiety nausea vomiting extreme stabbing postprandial abdominal pain due to both the duodenal compression and the compensatory reversed peristalsis abdominal distention distortion eructation external hypersensitivity or tenderness of the abdominal area reflux and heartburn	superior mesenteric artery syndrome

1 patients may also experience ear discharge and itchiness
2 pushing the tragus the tablike portion of the auricle that projects out just in front of the ear canal opening also typically causes pain in this condition as to be diagnostic of external otitis on physical examination
3 unlike other forms of ear infections the pain of acute external otitis is worsened when the outer ear is touched or pulled gently
4 ear pain is the predominant complaint and the only symptom directly related to the severity of acute external otitis	swimmer s ear
0 in children numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present

1 typical symptoms of the disorder include halos or auras surrounding objects trails following objects in motion difficulty distinguishing between colors apparent shifts in the hue of a given item the illusion of movement in a static setting air assuming a grainy or textured quality visual snow or static by popular description not to be confused with normal blue field entoptic phenomenon distortions in the dimensions of a perceived object and a heightened awareness of floaters
2 there are a number of perceptual changes that can accompany hppd	hallucinogen persisting perception disorder
0 hfmd usually resolves on its own after 7 10 days
1 painful facial ulcers blisters or lesions may also develop in or around the nose or mouth
2 the rash is rarely itchy for children but can be extremely itchy for adults
3 skin lesions frequently develop in the form of a rash of flat discolored spots and bumps which may be followed by vesicular sores with blisters on palms of the hands soles of the feet buttocks and sometimes on the lips
4 common constitutional signs and symptoms of the hfmd include fever nausea vomiting feeling tired generalized discomfort loss of appetite and irritability in infants and toddlers	hand foot mouth disease
0 there may also be associated oral malodor intra oral halitosis
1 apart from the appearance the condition is typically asymptomatic but sometimes people may experience a gagging sensation or a bad taste
2 discoloration usually accompanies hairy tongue and may be yellow brown or black
3 hairy tongue largely occurs in the central part of the dorsal tongue just anterior in front of the circumvallate papillae although sometimes the entire dorsal surface may be involved	black hairy tongue
0 it is hence easy to mistakenly diagnose rett syndrome for autism
1 during regression some features are similar to those of autism
2 the brief period of developmental progress is followed by stagnation and regression of previously acquired skills
3 however closer scrutiny reveals disturbance of the normal spontaneous limb and body movements that are thought to be regulated in the brainstem
4 the infant with rett syndrome often avoids detection until 6 18 months owing to a relatively normal appearance and some developmental progress
5 early on autistic like behavior may be seen
6 hand stereotypes are typical and breathing irregularities such as hyperventilation breathholding or sighing are seen in many
7 a period of developmental stagnation is followed by developmental regression where language and motor milestones regress purposeful hand use is lost and acquired deceleration in the rate of head growth resulting in microcephaly in some is seen
8 during this time there are subtle developmental deviations and early indicators of rett syndrome
9 onset occurs between 6 and 18 months of age
10 initial development is normal	rett syndrome
0 symptoms include
1 symptoms of pkan begin before middle childhood and most often are noticed before ten years of age
2 symptoms typically begin in childhood and are progressive often resulting in death by early adulthood	neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation nbia
0 leukemic cells may gather in the spleen and cause it to swell this can have the side effect of making the person feel full even when he or she has not eaten much
1 consequently patients may develop infections related to low white blood cell count anemia and fatigue due to a lack of red blood cells or easy bleeding due to a low platelet count
2 in hairy cell leukemia the hairy cells malignant b lymphocytes accumulate in the bone marrow interfering with the production of normal white blood cells red blood cells and platelets	hairy cell leukemia

0 meningococcal rash can usually be confirmed by a glass test in which the rash does not fade away under pressure
1 a rash can develop under the skin due to blood leakage that may leave red or brownish pinprick spots which can develop into purple bruising
2 this is due to the release of toxins into the blood that break down the walls of blood vessels
3 small bleeds into the skin cause the characteristic petechial rash which appears with a star like shape
4 dic can cause ischemic tissue damage when upstream thrombi obstruct blood flow and haemorrhage because clotting factors are exhausted
5 meningococcemia like many other gram negative blood infections can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation dic which is the inappropriate clotting of blood within the vessels	meningitis meningococcal
0 a wide spectrum of severity exists in chronic presentations symptoms may last months but fulminant infection particularly associated with near drowning may present with severe symptoms over hours
1 the potential for prolonged incubation was recognized in us servicemen involved in the vietnam war and was referred to as the vietnam time bomb

0 typical fragility fractures occur in the vertebral column rib hip and wrist
1 osteoporotic fractures occur in situations where healthy people would not normally break a bone they are therefore regarded as fragility fractures
2 osteoporosis itself has no symptoms its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures	osteoporosis overview
0 it can also result in blindness facial paralysis and deafness due to the increased pressure put on the nerves by the extra bone

0 more recently there is mounting evidence that the cerebellum which controls motor function may be crucially involved in some cases of foreign accent syndrome reinforcing the notion that speech pattern alteration is mechanical and thus non specific
1 contrary to popular beliefs that individuals with fas exhibit their accent without any effort these individuals feel as if they are suffering from a speech disorder
2 however researchers at oxford university have found that certain specific parts of the brain were injured in some foreign accent syndrome cases indicating that certain parts of the brain control various linguistic functions and damage could result in altered pitch or mispronounced syllables causing speech patterns to be distorted in a non specific manner

0 this stabilization is often interrupted by floaters especially when they tend to remain visible
1 although the blood vessels of the eye also obstruct light they are invisible under normal circumstances because they are fixed in location relative to the retina and the brain tunes out stabilized images due to neural adaptation
2 floaters are in fact visible only because they do not remain perfectly fixed within the eye
3 however attempting to shift one s gaze toward them can be difficult as floaters follow the motion of the eye remaining to the side of the direction of gaze
4 when they are first noticed the natural reaction is to attempt to look directly at them
5 thus floaters follow the rapid motions of the eye while drifting slowly within the fluid
6 it lies within the vitreous chamber behind the lens and is one of the four optical components of the eye
7 the vitreous humour or vitreous body is a jelly like transparent substance that fills a majority of the eye
8 eye floaters are suspended in the vitreous humour the thick fluid or gel that fills the eye	floater

4 eventually non invasive breathing assistance won t be enough to compensate for the loss of normal lung function
5 significant shortness of breath
6 increasing body paralysis which means they ll need help with most daily activities
7 as progresses to its final phase a person with the condition will probably experience
8 as progresses a non invasive breathing mask may be recommended at night to improve sleep quality and help reduce drowsiness during the day
9 others may wake up in the night because of breathlessness
10 some people find it difficult to breathe when they re lying down
11 shortness of breath may be particularly troublesome at night
12 however over time the person may even become short of breath when they re resting
13 this may be a feeling of being very short of breath after doing everyday tasks such as walking up the stairs

50 increasingly slurred speech dysarthria is usually the first sign of this type of and may be misdiagnosed as a stroke
51 in a quarter of cases problems initially affect the muscles used for speech and swallowing
52 bulbar onset
53 these symptoms are usually painless and may be accompanied by widespread twitching of the muscles fasciculations or muscle cramps and there may be visible wasting of the muscles with significant weight loss

37 this can affect the spleen s normal functions such as removing old or damaged blood cells from the blood
38 portal hypertension also diverts blood to the spleen causing it to become enlarged
39 these veins then become swollen particularly in the lower gullet oesophagus and if they get too big they can bleed
40 when this occurs blood bypasses the liver and is diverted into veins
41 this restricts the blood flow through the liver and increases the pressure in its delicate blood vessels portal hypertension
42 over time the liver can also develop fibrosis a process similar to scarring

9 infants with lambdoid synostosis will develop a flattened head at the back
10 fusion occurs in the lambdoid suture which runs along the back of the head
11 lambdoid synostosis is the rarest type of and occurs in about 2 4 of cases
12 lambdoid synostosis
13 infants with metopic synostosis will develop a pointed scalp that looks triangular
14 the fusion occurs in the metopic synostosis which is the suture that runs from the nose to the top of the skull

16 metopic synostosis
17 if both coronal sutures are fused the infant will develop a flat and prominent forehead and brow
18 they may also have a raised eye socket and a crooked nose
19 if only one coronal suture is fused the infant will develop a flattened forehead on the affected side

22 coronal is the second most common type of after sagittal synostosis accounting for around one in four cases
23 coronal
24 this leads to a lack of growth in width and compensatory growth in length resulting in a long narrow skull
25 it occurs when the suture at the top of the skull the sagittal suture fuses
26 sagittal synostosis is the most common type of accounting for around half of all cases

8 the pain is often worse when you use your arm particularly for twisting movements
9 the pain of can range from mild discomfort while using your to severe pain that can be felt when your is still
10 you may also have pain in your forearm and in the back of your hand
11 causes pain and tenderness on the outside of your	tennis elbow
0 therefore awareness of this problem and frequent check ups possibly twice a year with a dermatologist are recommended
1 it is estimated that more than half of people with severe generalised recessive deb will develop skin cancer by the time they are 35
2 people with this type of deb have a high risk of developing skin cancer at the site of repeated scarring
3 there may be areas of missing skin at birth or blistering developing very shortly afterwards
4 the symptoms of severe generalised recessive deb are usually present at birth
5 the eyes can also be affected by blistering and scarring which is painful and can lead to vision problems
6 as a result many children with this form of deb will experience anaemia malnutrition and delayed or reduced growth
7 repeated blisters on the scalp may also reduce hair growth
8 this can often cause problems with speaking chewing and swallowing
9 tooth decay and repeated scarring in and around the mouth are both common
10 anus
11 oesophagus tube connecting the mouth and stomach
12 mouth
13 extensive blistering can also occur on the mucus membranes particularly inside the
14 spaces between fingers and toes can fill with scar tissue so hands and feet take on a mitten like appearance
15 repeated scarring to hands and feet can result in the loss of nails
16 it causes severe and widespread skin blistering that often leaves areas covered with persistent ulcers
17 severe generalised recessive deb is the most severe type of deb
18 dystrophic recessive severe generalised
19 the symptoms of dominant deb usually develop at birth or shortly afterwards but may not occur until later in childhood
20 some people with dominant deb have mild symptoms with very few blisters and the only sign of the disease may be misshapen or missing nails
21 the mouth is often affected which can make eating or cleaning teeth painful
22 the nails will usually become thickened and abnormally shaped or even lost altogether
23 milia tiny white spots often form at the site of the blisters
24 dominant deb causes blistering at places on the body that experience trauma often the hands feet arms and legs which usually results in scarring
25 dystrophic dominant
26 the three most common variants of dystrophic deb are discussed below
27 sepsis and respiratory failure due to blistering and narrowing of the airways are the most common causes of death
28 around 40 of children with the condition won t survive the first year of life and most won t survive more than five years
29 because of these complications the outlook for children with herlitz jeb is very poor
30 sepsis
31 breathing difficulties
32 dehydration
33 malnutrition and delayed growth
34 tooth enamel defects and decay
35 anaemia
36 complications of herlitz jeb are common and include
37 the eyes
38 inside the mouth and throat
39 the neck
40 the toes
41 the fingertips
42 around the nose and mouth
43 the genitals and buttocks
44 in particular the following areas of the body are affected by blistering and chronic ulcers
45 herlitz jeb causes widespread blistering of both the skin and the mucus membranes
46 this is the most severe type of jeb although it s incredibly rare
47 jeb generalised herlitz
48 as adults people with this form of have an increased risk of developing skin cancer so regular review by a dermatologist skin specialist familiar with is recommended
49 the symptoms usually develop at birth or shortly afterwards and can improve with age
50 some patients also develop problems with the urinary tract such as blistering or scarring of the urethra tube urine passes through from the bladder
51 the mouth is also frequently affected by blisters and ulcers which may make eating difficult
52 tooth enamel isn t properly formed which means teeth may be discoloured fragile and prone to tooth decay
53 pigmented coloured areas of skin that look like large irregular moles
54 deformity or loss of fingernails and toenails
55 scarring of the skin
56 long term injuries to the skin and underlying tissue especially of the lower legs
57 other common symptoms include
58 blistering of the scalp is common and may lead to scarring and permanent hair loss
59 non herlitz jeb causes widespread blistering of the skin and mucus membranes
60 jeb localised non herlitz
61 there are two main variants of junctional jeb discussed below
62 however it s common for the skin of the palms and soles to become progressively thicker with age and this may make walking or activities using the hands difficult or painful
63 the symptoms usually develop at birth but the blistering gradually improves through childhood and adolescence so adults may only experience occasional blistering
64 thickening or loss of the fingernails and toenails is another common symptom
65 blisters can also develop inside the mouth and throat making eating and sometimes speaking difficult and painful
66 painful blisters on the soles of the feet can affect an infant s ability to walk and may mean they start to walk later
67 the widespread blistering can make the skin vulnerable to infection and affect an infant s normal feeding pattern which means they may not develop at the expected rate
68 in the most severe cases a child can develop up to 200 blisters in a single day
69 this form of is the most severe type where children experience widespread blistering
70 generalised severe
71 as with localised adults may experience thickening of the skin on their palms and the soles of their feet as well as their fingernails and toenails
72 the symptoms usually begin during birth or infancy
73 scarring and milia small white spots may occur on the skin but this is uncommon
74 there may be mild blistering of the mucus membranes such as the inside of the nose mouth and throat
75 the symptoms are also usually more troublesome during hot weather
76 in this form of blisters can form anywhere on the body in response to friction or trauma
77 generalised intermediate
78 some adults with localised may experience thickening of the skin on their palms and the soles of their feet as well as their fingernails and toenails
79 symptoms usually become apparent during early childhood although mild cases may go undiagnosed until early adolescence
80 the blisters usually heal without scarring
81 excessive sweating can make the blisters worse so localised is often more noticeable during the summer
82 although the blisters often form on the hands and feet it s not uncommon for them to develop on other parts of the body as well such as the buttocks or inner thighs after they ve been subjected to friction during activities such as riding a bike
83 it s characterised by painful blisters on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet that develop after mild or moderate physical activity such as walking gardening or playing sport
84 localised is the most common form of

100 although specific symptoms depend on the type of there are some common features including
101 symptoms of can vary in severity ranging from mild to life threatening	epidermolysis bullosa
0 not all seizures are epileptic
1 the word seizure means any sudden short event that changes a person s awareness behaviour or feelings
2 other conditions such as diabetes heart conditions and psychological conditions can cause seizures
3 these are called non epileptic seizures
4 if you have tried one of these treatments and the seizures are continuing call 999 for an ambulance
5 a medication called buccal midazolam that comes in liquid form and is given by trickling the liquid onto the inside of the person s cheek
6 a medication called diazepam that is placed in the person s rectum
7 if you have been trained to treat the condition you will usually have been advised to use either
8 you can be trained to treat status epilepticus if you care for someone with but if you haven t had any training it is important to call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you suspect status epilepticus
9 this is a medical emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible
10 status epilepticus is the name for any seizure that lasts longer than 30 minutes or a series of seizures where the person does not regain consciousness in between
11 the person s behaviour after a seizure is unsafe
12 the person is injured has breathing problems or needs emergency medical attention for any other reason
13 you know it is the person s first seizure
14 the person has more than one seizure without recovering in between
15 the seizure has not stopped after five minutes
16 however you should call 999 if
17 it will not usually be necessary to call an ambulance after a seizure
18 when to call an ambulance
19 stay with them and comfort them until they have fully recovered
20 only attempt to move them if they are in immediate danger
21 protect them from injury by removing any dangerous or potentially harmful objects nearby and cushioning their head with your hands or soft material
22 if someone is having one of the other types of seizure
23 other types of seizure
24 when the convulsions have stopped put them into the recovery position until they have recovered
25 stay calm and stay with them until they regain consciousness
26 do not restrain them or attempt to move them unless they are in immediate danger and don t put anything in their mouth
27 protect them from injury by removing any dangerous or potentially harmful objects nearby and cushioning their head with your hands or soft material
28 if you are with someone who has a tonic clonic seizure
29 tonic clonic seizures
30 if you see someone having a seizure there are simple things you can do to help
31 this type of seizure is what most people think of as an epileptic fit
32 the seizure normally lasts a few minutes but can last longer
33 you will lose consciousness and some people will wet themselves
34 your body will initially become stiff and then your arms and legs will begin twitching
35 tonic clonic seizures or convulsions which used to be known as grand mal have two stages
36 tonic clonic seizures
37 like atonic seizures there is a risk of injury
38 tonic seizures cause all your muscles to suddenly become stiff which can mean you lose balance and fall over
39 tonic seizures
40 atonic seizures cause all your muscles to suddenly relax so there is a chance you may fall to the ground and there is a risk you could injure yourself
41 atonic seizures
42 loss of consciousness may also occur
43 these cause the same sort of twitching as myoclonic jerks except the symptoms will last longer normally up to two minutes
44 clonic seizures
45 myoclonic jerks often happen in the first few hours after waking up and can occur in combination with other types of generalised seizures
46 they often only last for a fraction of a second and you will normally remain conscious during this time
47 these types of seizures cause your arms legs or upper body to jerk or twitch as if you have received an electric shock
48 myoclonic seizures
49 they may affect a child s performance at school and can be dangerous if they occur at a critical time such as crossing a busy road
50 absences can occur several times a day
51 the person will have no memory of the seizure
52 the person will seem to stare vacantly into space although some people will flutter their eyes or smack their lips
53 they cause the person to lose awareness of their surroundings usually for up to 15 seconds
54 absence seizures which used to be called petit mal mainly affect children but they also occur in adults
55 absences
56 there are six main types of generalised seizure
57 during a complex partial seizure you will not be able to respond to anyone else and you will have no memory of the event
58 chewing or swallowing
59 adopting an unusual posture
60 fiddling with objects
61 picking at clothes
62 moving your arms around
63 making random noises
64 rubbing your hands
65 smacking your lips
66 the symptoms of a complex partial seizure normally involve apparently strange and random bodily behaviour such as
67 complex partial seizures are when you lose your sense of awareness and can t remember what happened after the seizure has passed
68 complex partial seizures
69 this can give you time to warn people around you and make sure you are in a safe place
70 these seizures are sometimes known as warnings or auras because they can be a sign that another type of seizure is on its way
71 stiffness or twitching in part of the body such as an arm or hand
72 a sudden intense feeling of fear or joy
73 a tingling sensation or pins and needles in your arms and legs
74 experiencing an unusual smell or taste
75 an intense feeling that events have happened before d j vu
76 a rising feeling in your tummy sometimes likened to the sensation in your stomach when on a fairground ride
77 a general strange feeling that is hard to describe
78 symptoms of a simple partial seizure can include
79 simple partial seizures are where you remain fully conscious throughout
80 simple partial seizures
81 there are two main types of partial seizure
82 some seizures do not fit into these categories and are known as unclassified seizures
83 generalised seizures where most or all of the brain is affected
84 partial or focal seizures where only a small part of the brain is affected
85 there are
86 doctors classify seizures by how much of the brain is affected
87 seizures can occur when you are awake or asleep
88 people with can experience any type of seizure although most people have a consistent pattern of symptoms
89 there are many different types of seizure depending on the area of the brain affected
90 the main symptoms of are repeated seizures	epilepsy overview
0 withholding food which results in the child failing to develop physically and mentally at the expected rate
1 not treating mistreating genuine conditions so they will get worse
2 unconsciousness by suffocating their child
3 infecting their child s wounds injecting the child with dirt faeces stools
4 poisoning their child with unsuitable and non prescribed medicine
5 parents carers deliberately contaminating manipulating clinical tests to fake evidence of for example by adding blood glucose to urine samples placing their blood on the child s clothing to suggest unusual bleeding heating thermometers to suggest the presence of a fever
6 previous case reports of fii have uncovered evidence of parents carers lying about their child s symptoms
7 deliberately smothering the child to unconsciousness
8 poisoning the child with a poison of high toxicity for example using insulin to lower a child s blood sugar level
9 poisoning the child with a poison of low toxicity for example using a laxative to diarrhoea
10 symptoms by means other than poisoning smothering such as using chemicals to irritate their skin
11 intentionally withholding nutrients from the child interfering with nutritional intake
12 the categories are exaggerating symptoms and manipulating test results to suggest the presence of an
13 in the more severe cases of fii the parent carer may carry out behaviour from several all categories
14 these are ranked below from least severe to most severe
15 the patterns of abuse found in cases of fii usually fall into one of six categories
16 the parent carer encouraging medical staff to perform often painful tests and procedures on the child tests that most parents would only agree to if they were persuaded that it was absolutely necessary
17 one parent usually but not always the father having little no involvement in the care of the child
18 the parent career trying to maintain a close and friendly relationship with medical staff but quickly becoming abusive argumentative if their own views on what is wrong with the child are challenged
19 although the parent carer is very attentive to the child and stays with them constantly in hospital they do not seem too worried about the child s health overly worried in relation to the health professional in charge of their child s care
20 other identified warning signs include the parent carer having good medical knowledge a medical background
21 the child s daily activities are being limited far beyond what you would usually expect as a result of having a certain condition for example they never go to school have to wear leg braces even though they can walk properly
22 the parent carer has a history of frequently changing gps visiting different hospitals for treatment particularly if their views about the child s treatment are challenged by medical staff
23 the child s history of symptoms does not result in expected medical outcomes for example a child who has supposedly lost a lot of blood but doesn t become unwell
24 if a particular health problem is resolved the parent carer suddenly begins reporting a new set of symptoms
25 the affected child has an inexplicably poor response to medication other treatment
26 the only person claiming to notice symptoms is the parent carer
27 one more of the following warning signs must also be present symptoms only appear when the parent carer is present
28 the national institute for health and care excellence nice guidance on when to suspect child maltreatment pdf 235kb states that may first be suspected if physical psychological examination and diagnostic tests do not explain the reported signs and symptoms
29 the abuse that occurs in fii takes a range of forms and can be difficult to recognise but there are warning signs to look out for	munchausen syndrome by proxy
0 other people claiming to post on their behalf such as a parent or partner but they use exactly the same pattern of writing
1 feigning an attitude of unconcern when they talk about serious problems probably to attract attention and sympathy
2 claiming to have continual dramatic events in their life such as loved ones dying or being the victim of a violent crime particularly when other group members have become a focus of attention
3 making fantastic claims that they later contradict or others disprove at a later date for example they may claim to be attending a certain hospital that does not actually exist
4 making claims of near fatal bouts of illness followed by a miraculous recovery
5 reports of experiencing symptoms that appear to be much more severe than most people would experience
6 posts and messages that contain large chunks of information and appear to have been directly copied from health websites such as nhs choices
7 one expert on by internet has compiled a list of warning signs that indicate someone may be affected by the condition including
8 people with genuine health conditions have reported feelings of betrayal and anger upon discovering they have been lied to
9 while these actions may only be confined to the internet they can have an incredibly destructive effect on support groups and online communities
10 this is where a person joins an internet support group for people with a serious health condition such as cystic fibrosis or leukaemia and then claims to have the illness themselves
11 a relatively new condition has been labelled by internet
12 telling highly unbelievable and often very elaborate stories about their past such as claiming to be a decorated war hero or that their parents are fantastically rich and powerful
13 reporting symptoms that are vague and inconsistent or reporting a pattern of symptoms that are textbook examples of certain conditions
14 being willing to undergo often painful or dangerous tests and procedures
15 receiving few or no hospital visitors many people with adopt a solitary lifestyle and have little contact with friends or family
16 having very good medical knowledge
17 having symptoms that get worse for no apparent reason
18 having symptoms that do not correspond to test results
19 claiming to have a history of complex and serious medical conditions with little documentary evidence to support this people often claim they have spent a long time out of the country
20 making frequent visits to hospitals in different areas
21 some clues that a person may have include
22 aggravating pre existing conditions for example rubbing faeces into wounds to cause an infection or reopening previously healed wounds
23 self infliction for example cutting or burning themselves poisoning themselves with drugs or eating food contaminated with bacteria
24 tampering with test results for example heating a thermometer to suggest a fever or adding blood to a urine sample
25 lying about symptoms for example choosing symptoms that are difficult to disprove such as having a severe headache or pretending to have a seizure fit or to pass out
26 there are four main ways people with fake or induce illnesses including
27 symptoms and signs of may include pretending to be ill or self harming to aggravate or induce illness	munchausen s syndrome

1 due to the risk of serious heart and respiratory problems someone with emery dreifuss md will often have a shortened life expectancy
2 the slow heartbeat can often be treated successfully with an implanted pacemaker
3 this can result in people with the condition developing an abnormally slow heartbeat and palpitations which can lead to episodes of lightheadedness or fainting
4 emery dreifuss md can also affect the heart s electrical signals causing heart block
5 people with emery dreifuss md will often eventually require a wheelchair as they become unable to walk
6 later on the hip and thigh muscles become weaker making activities such as walking up stairs difficult
7 this can make it difficult to lift heavy objects or raise your arms above your head and you may have an increased tendency to trip over things
8 like all types of md emery dreifuss md also causes progressive muscle weakness usually beginning in the shoulders upper arms and lower legs
9 this means that people with emery dreifuss md may have difficulty straightening their elbows or bending their neck forward for example
10 areas commonly affected by muscle contractures include the arms neck and feet
11 in the early stages people with the condition usually develop muscle contractures where the muscles and tendons become shortened and tightened limiting the range of movement at nearby joints
12 people with emery dreifuss md often begin to develop symptoms during childhood or adolescence
13 however with treatment to manage the symptoms a person s life expectancy isn t usually altered
14 this can lead to chest infections if food and drink is accidentally swallowed the wrong way into the lungs
15 dysphagia can eventually make it difficult to swallow solid foods liquids and even small amounts of saliva
16 it s also possible to develop double vision
17 as the eyelids droop they can cover the eyes and impair vision
18 limb weakness around the shoulders and hips
19 progressive restriction of eye movement as the eye muscles become affected
20 difficulty swallowing
21 symptoms of oculopharyngeal md can include droopy eyelids
22 it affects the muscles in the eyes ocular and the throat pharyngeal
23 in oculopharyngeal md symptoms aren t usually apparent until a person is around 50 or 60 years old
24 many types get worse slowly whereas others can develop more rapidly
25 how quickly limb girdle md progresses depends on the specific type
26 the muscle weakness will create problems such as difficulty lifting objects running or getting out of a low seat
27 heart palpitations or irregular heartbeats
28 back pain
29 loss of muscle mass in the affected areas
30 if you have limb girdle md you may experience muscle weakness in your hips thighs and arms
31 males and females are equally affected
32 symptoms of limb girdle md usually begin in late childhood or early adulthood although the condition can affect people younger or older than this depending on the specific type
33 it then progresses to the shoulder girdle girdle means the bones around the shoulder or hip
34 the first symptoms are often mobility problems affecting the hip girdle
35 limb girdle md refers to a number of related conditions that cause weakness in the big muscle groups at the base of the arms and legs around the shoulders and hips
36 however becker md progresses at a slower rate than duchenne md and those with the condition often have a normal lifespan
37 if you have becker md you re also at risk of developing dilated cardiomyopathy and breathing problems
38 for example one person with becker md may be unable to walk by the time they re 16 while another person with the condition may be able to walk until they re 80
39 a person with becker md will often eventually need a wheelchair by the time they re 40 50 years old although this is highly variable
40 as they get older they may also find lifting objects above waist height difficult
41 during late childhood or early adulthood people with becker md often find they have difficulty running walking quickly and climbing stairs
42 struggle with sports at school
43 have muscle cramps when exercising
44 for example a child with the condition may learn to walk later than usual
45 symptoms of becker md usually begin in childhood but they re often relatively mild at this point
46 becker md also affects similar areas of the body to duchenne md although the symptoms tend to be less severe
47 like duchenne md becker md mostly affects boys
48 as the condition progresses slowly it doesn t usually shorten life expectancy
49 facioscapulohumeral md can develop unevenly so the muscles on one side of the body may be affected more than the other
50 around half of all people with facioscapulohumeral md develop weakness in their leg muscles and one or two in every 10 people with the condition will eventually need a wheelchair
51 calves
52 upper back
53 upper arms humeral

63 men also tend to be affected earlier and more severely
64 it tends to affect men slightly more than women although the reason for this is unclear
65 facioscapulohumeral md can affect both men and women
66 myotonic can cause difficulties with general anaesthetics and childbirth
67 if you have myotonic it s important that you re well informed about your condition and that you tell any healthcare professionals you see that you have it
68 most deaths related to myotonic are related to pneumonia breathing problems or heart problems
69 some people who first develop symptoms as a child or teenager may also have a shortened life expectancy
70 many people have a normal life expectancy but people with the more severe congenital form present from birth may die while still a newborn baby or only survive for a few years
71 life expectancy for people with myotonic can vary considerably
72 in some people the condition can also cause cataracts to develop at a younger age than usual
73 this is because there s a risk of the electrical impulses that control the heartbeat travelling too slowly through the heart
74 some people with myotonic may never have a significant disability although their heart rate will need to be monitored for abnormalities
75 however it can become more severe as it s passed down through the generations
76 myotonic is highly variable and often gets worse very slowly with little change over long periods of time
77 a slow and irregular heartbeat cardiac arrhythmia
78 behavioural and learning problems in children
79 difficulty swallowing
80 excessive sleeping or sleepiness
81 clouding of the lens in the eye cataracts
82 as well as muscle weakness and wasting symptoms can include muscle stiffness myotonia
83 it affects the same number of men and women
84 myotonic can appear at any time between birth and old age
85 however it s often the smaller muscles that are affected first such as those in the face jaw and neck
86 as with other types of myotonic involves progressive muscle weakness and muscle wasting
87 with medical care most people with duchenne md die from heart or respiratory failure before or during their 30s
88 once the heart and respiratory muscles are damaged duchenne md becomes life threatening
89 the condition can also affect the intercostal muscles muscle tissue between the ribs and the diaphragm the large thin sheet of muscle between the chest and abdomen
90 by their late teens or early 20s people with duchenne md may start to have breathing problems
91 this condition affects the heart muscles causing the heart s chambers to enlarge and the walls to get thinner

102 children with duchenne md usually start to have noticeable symptoms between one and three years of age
103 girls can occasionally be affected although the condition tends to be milder in females
104 as a result of the way it s inherited see causes of md duchenne md mostly affects boys
105 uk also provides a dropdown list of specific muscle weakening conditions
106 typical symptoms of some of the most common types of md are explained below
107 all types cause muscle weakness but the areas affected and the severity of the symptoms are different
108 there are many different types of md	muscular dystrophy
0 physical activity often leads to tiredness because the muscles are weak
1 washing hair
2 brushing teeth particularly with the repetitive action involved
3 climbing stairs
4 rising from sitting to standing
5 the specific muscles affected promixal muscles often leads to difficulty
6 this can cause mobility problems such as a waddling gait head drop and difficulty performing physical tasks such as lifting
7 can sometimes affect the muscles of the arms legs and neck
8 moderate to severe swallowing or breathing problems may require urgent admission to hospital for medical care
9 a small number of people with also have breathing difficulties particularly when lying flat in bed or after exercise
10 sometimes this leads to recurrent chest infections
11 if tongue or palate weakness develops this can lead to swallowing difficulties dysphagia with coughing and choking symptoms
12 if the muscles around the mouth or tongue become weak this may lead to difficulty chewing and talking dysarthria and may cause husky or quiet speech or a nasal sounding voice
13 for example in some cases a person may appear to have a snarling smile because of lower facial weakness
14 where the facial muscles are involved a person s facial expression may be affected
15 if this continues for a period of two years or more it becomes increasingly unlikely for other symptoms of to develop
16 in some cases the eye muscles remain the only muscles affected ocular
17 around 90 of people with the condition have problems with their eye muscles at some point
18 there may also be blurred or double vision often at the end of the day or when a person is tired
19 in one or both eyelids may droop ptosis
20 the muscle weakness of isn t usually painful in itself but people with the condition often experience aching muscles particularly during or after periods of physical activity
21 the severity of muscle weakness varies from one person to another
22 however slurred speech swallowing problems or neck or limb weakness can occur first
23 weakness of the eye muscles is often the first symptom to develop in around 50 of cases
24 the symptoms of can come on suddenly but it may take some time before the condition is correctly diagnosed
25 the eye and facial muscles and those that control swallowing are commonly affected
26 muscle weakness is the main symptom of	myasthenia gravis

9 as well as the symptoms described above can cause a number of other symptoms including
10 other symptoms
11 although sleep paralysis doesn t cause any harm being unable to move can be frightening
12 the episodes can last from a few seconds to several minutes
13 this is a temporary inability to move or speak that occurs when waking up or falling asleep
14 some people with experience episodes of sleep paralysis
15 sleep paralysis
16 in an attempt to avoid attacks some people may become emotionally withdrawn and socially isolated
17 some people with have cataplexy attacks once or twice a year while others experience them several times a day
18 attacks can last from a few seconds to several minutes
19 cataplexy attacks are usually triggered by an emotion such as excitement laughter anger or surprise
20 double vision or finding it difficult to focus
21 slurred speech
22 legs collapsing uncontrollably
23 the head slumping down
24 the jaw dropping
25 typical symptoms are

0 read more about diagnosing
1 can be a difficult condition to diagnose so it s important to try to describe your symptoms as accurately and in as much detail as possible
2 your gp will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain
3 you should see your gp if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain particularly if standard painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes
4 even when pain free you may live in fear of the pain returning
5 during periods of extreme pain some people may even consider suicide
6 the emotional strain of living with repeated episodes of pain can lead to psychological problems such as depression
7 however it s important to try to live a normal life and be aware that becoming undernourished or dehydrated can make the pain far worse
8 you may feel like avoiding activities such as washing shaving or eating to avoid triggering pain and the fear of pain may mean you avoid social activities
9 living with can be extremely difficult and your quality of life can be significantly affected

25 you may have episodes of pain lasting regularly for days weeks or months at a time
26 there may also be a constant throbbing aching or burning sensation between attacks
27 after the main severe pain has subsided you may experience a slight ache or burning feeling
28 you may feel aware of an impending attack of pain though these usually come unexpectedly
29 the pain can be in the teeth the lower jaw upper jaw cheek and less commonly in the forehead or the eye
30 in rare cases it can affect both sides although not at the same time
31 usually only affects one side of your face
32 the attacks can be so severe that you are unable to do anything during them and the pain can sometimes bring you to your knees
33 the pain is often described as an excruciating sensation similar to an electric shock
34 the main symptom of is sudden attacks of severe sharp and shooting facial pain that last from a few seconds to about two minutes	trigeminal neuralgia
0 make sure you re cared for by an obstetrician with knowledge of nf1 or speak to your nf1 specialist
1 however the number of neurofibromas may increase because of hormone changes
2 most women with nf1 have healthy pregnancies
3 there are currently two such centres one in guy s st thomas nhs foundation trust in london and the other in the central manchester university hospitals nhs foundation trust
4 you should be referred to a specialist centre with experience in diagnosing and treating mpnst
5 if you have any of these symptoms contact the doctor in charge of your care as soon as possible

11 the texture of an existing neurofibroma changing from soft to hard
12 symptoms of an mpnst include
13 most cases first develop when people are in their late twenties or early thirties but can occur at any age
14 it s estimated that people with nf1 have a 10 chance over their lifetime of developing a mpnst
15 mpnsts are a of cancer that develops within a plexiform neurofibroma see above
16 one of the most serious problems that can affect a person with nf1 is a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour mpnst
17 this tends to be a mild form of epilepsy that s controlled easily with medication
18 around 7 of children with nf1 develop epilepsy where a person has repeated seizures or fits
19 difficulties with balance and co ordination

23 the tumours may cause no noticeable symptoms
24 around 5 of people develop brain tumours
25 many people with nf1 experience migraines although they re not specific to nf1 and are common in people who don t have the condition
26 symptoms affecting the brain and nervous system are relatively common in nf1
27 vitamin d comes from sunlight and may be found in milk cheese yoghurt and oily fish
28 vitamin d is needed to keep the bones strong
29 some people with nf1 have very low levels of vitamin d
30 this usually causes it to curve known as leg bowing
31 the fracture doesn t heal completely which affects the normal movement of the leg
32 in rare cases the condition can affect long bones in the arm ulnar or radius
33 this is when abnormal bone development leads to a minor bone fracture usually in the bone of the lower leg the tibia
34 around 2 of children with nf1 develop pseudarthrosis
35 smaller size and weight than normal this is common in many people with nf1
36 a larger than average head this occurs in around half of all children
37 a curved spine scoliosis thought to affect around 10 of children with nf1
38 these can include
39 many children with nf1 have one or more problems affecting their physical development
40 children and adults with nf1 are recommended to have regular blood pressure checks usually at least once a year
41 high blood pressure may be associated with potentially serious complications such as a stroke or a heart attack if it s not treated
42 this causes a release of certain hormones such as adrenaline which raise blood pressure
43 in rare cases high blood pressure may be caused by a tumour called a phaeochromocytoma
44 the kidneys help keep blood pressure at a healthy level
45 this is thought to be because the normal workings of the kidneys are affected by narrowing of the arteries
46 some children with nf1 develop high blood pressure
47 these are known as lisch nodules and don t usually cause any noticeable symptoms or vision problems
48 another common feature of nf1 is the appearance of tiny brown spots in the iris the coloured central part of the eye
49 the best way of detecting these tumours is to have eye tests at least every year until your child is at least seven years old
50 you should be aware of any indications your child has difficulty seeing such as problems picking up small objects or bumping into things

75 plexiform neurofibromas sometimes occur on the skin but may also develop on larger nerves deeper in the body
76 however if neurofibromas develop where multiple branches of nerves come together plexiform neurofibromas they can cause large swellings
77 most neurofibromas aren t particularly painful but may look unattractive catch on clothes and occasionally cause irritation and stinging
78 some people only have a small number while others have them on large sections of their body
79 the number of neurofibromas a person has can vary
80 some neurofibromas have a purple colour
81 they may vary in size from pea sized to slightly bigger tumours
82 these are caused by non cancerous tumours that develop on the coverings of nerves
83 as a child gets older usually during teenage years or early adulthood they develop bumps on or under their skin neurofibromas
84 bumps on or under the skin
85 another common symptom of nf1 is clusters of freckles in unusual places such as the armpits groin and under the breast
86 freckles
87 about one in 10 people without the condition have one or two of these spots
88 having a couple of caf au lait spots doesn t necessarily mean you have nf1
89 for example a person with 10 spots has the same chance of developing further problems as someone with 100 spots
90 the number of caf au lait spots someone has isn t related to the severity of the condition
91 these grow to about 15mm during adulthood
92 during childhood most children with nf1 will have at least six caf au lait spots around 5mm across
93 the spots can be present at birth or develop by the time a child is three years old
94 they affect 95 of people with nf1

11 read more about bowel incontinence and urinary incontinence
12 there can also be problems with sexual function
13 bowel incontinence may involve periods of constipation followed by episodes of diarrhoea or soiling due to stools overflowing from the bowel
14 if left untreated this can lead to problems such as recurrent urinary tract infections utis and kidney damage
15 the bladder muscle may be very tight or twitchy and only store a little urine which can mean there is a constant slow dribble of urine from the bladder
16 many people with have limited or no control over their sphincter muscles and experience urinary and bowel incontinence
17 they help to control the muscles that keep urine in the bladder and stools in the bowel sphincter muscles
18 as well as controlling your limbs the nerves that run through your spinal cord also control your bowel and bladder
19 this can result in dislocated or deformed joints bone fractures misshapen bones and an abnormal curvature of the spine scoliosis
20 as the muscles support the bones this weakness can affect bone development
21 for example as the muscles in the legs are not being used regularly they can become severely weakened
22 paralysis can also cause other associated problems
23 in cases of more severe paralysis the child will require a wheelchair
24 if a child with has weakness they may need to use ankle supports or crutches to help with their mobility
25 most children with will experience some degree of weakness or paralysis in their lower limbs
26 any damage to the nerves can result in problems controlling the muscles
27 the brain controls all the muscles in the body with the nerves that run through the spinal cord
28 a baby is more likely to have cognitive symptoms if he or she develops hydrocephalus
29 causing a gap higher up the back is more likely to cause paralysis of the lower limbs and mobility difficulties compared with gaps in the middle or at the base of the back
30 the severity of the symptoms can vary considerably largely depending on where on the spine the opening occurs

7 weakness of the facial and tongue muscles which may cause difficulty swallowing dysphagia and slurred speech
8 as the condition progresses it may cause other symptoms including
9 the initial symptoms of kennedy s syndrome may include tremor shaking of the hands muscle cramps on exertion muscle twitches and weakness of the limb muscles

20 muscle tremor shaking and twitching
21 difficulty walking
22 muscle weakness in the hands and feet
23 the symptoms are usually mild to moderate and may include
24 type iv sma is a less common form that begins in adulthood
25 breathing and swallowing difficulties are very rare and the condition doesn t usually affect life expectancy
26 over time the muscles of children with type iii sma become weaker resulting in some children losing the ability to walk when they get older
27 a slight tremor shaking of their fingers
28 difficulty running or climbing steps
29 difficulty walking
30 balance problems
31 they may also have
32 most children with type iii sma are able to stand unaided and walk although many find walking or getting up from a sitting position difficult
33 symptoms of muscle weakness usually appear after 18 months of age but this is very variable and sometimes the symptoms may not appear until late childhood or early adulthood
34 type iii sma also known as kugelberg welander disease is the mildest form of childhood sma
35 the majority of children with type ii sma are now expected to survive into adulthood
36 although type ii sma may shorten life expectancy improvements in care standards mean most people can live long fulfilling and productive lives
37 this can make them more vulnerable to respiratory infections
38 a child with type ii sma has weak respiratory muscles which can make it difficult for them to cough effectively
39 this is an abnormal curvature of the spine caused by the muscles supporting the bones of the spine becoming weaker
40 as they grow many children with type ii sma develop scoliosis
41 in some cases deformities of the hands feet chest and joints develop as the muscles shrink

47 infants with type ii sma are usually able to sit but cannot stand or walk unaided
48 the symptoms are less severe than type i but become more noticeable in older children
49 symptoms of type ii sma usually appear when an infant is 7 18 months old
50 because of the high risk of serious respiratory problems most children with type i sma die in the first few years of life
51 breathing problems can be caused by weakness in the baby s chest muscles and difficulty swallowing can be made worse by weakness of the muscles in the tongue and throat
52 they re usually unable to raise their head or sit without support
53 the muscles of babies with type i sma are thin and weak which makes their limbs limp and floppy
54 these symptoms are usually apparent at birth or during the first few months of life
55 it causes severe muscle weakness which can result in problems moving eating breathing and swallowing
56 type i sma also known as werdnig hoffmann disease is believed to be the most common form
57 the most common forms of sma are usually divided into four types described below
58 the muscles closest to the centre of the body such as the shoulders hips and back proximal muscles are usually affected first and most severely
59 it causes the muscles throughout the body to become weak and shrink
60 in general sma affects a person s physical abilities such as moving walking and breathing but doesn t affect their mental development
61 there are several different types of sma the condition is classified according to the age at which symptoms develop and the level of muscle weakness it causes	spinal muscular atrophy
